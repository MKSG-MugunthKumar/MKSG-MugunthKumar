# Hi there, I'm Mugunth Kumar (MK) 👋

## About Me

I'm an engineering leader with 20+ years of experience in software architecture, AI/ML, and team leadership, based in Melbourne, Australia. As **CTO of Pink Cloud**, I'm spearheading the Australian expansion of our evidence-based addiction recovery platform from California, building strategic partnerships with the University of Melbourne, Monash University, and government health sectors.

I build purpose-driven technology that creates real social impact. With expertise in Python, AWS, iOS development, and building high-performance engineering teams, I believe every line of code should contribute to making the world better — whether through open-source developer tools, AI-powered learning platforms, or technology that supports individuals in recovery.
